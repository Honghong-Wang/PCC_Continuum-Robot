# 2D and 3D Constant Curvature Kinematics
* **Author:** [Turhan Can KargÄ±n](https://github.com/turhancan97)
* **Topic:** Part of Master Thesis


The repository we prepared for first part of my master thesis which is called [The Control of Soft Continuum Robot by Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/turhancan97/RL-based-Control-of-a-Soft-Continuum-Robot). Main purpose of this repository is to show 2D and 3D Kinematic Modeling of Constant Curvature Continuum Robots.

## To-Do's
- [ ] Add 3D implementation for matlab and python
- [ ] Prepare good mathmematical explanation for README.md
